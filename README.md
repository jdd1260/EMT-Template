# Express, Mongo, and Typescript Template Project

This is meant to be some basic starter code for an Express API using MongoDB written in Typescript. It has already configured Mongo, Express, Typescript, Prettier/ESLint, and Jest to make it easy to get up and running. Some of the setup is opinionated, but there is nothing that can't be changed in a new project. The goal here is simply to provide everything you need to get started quickly. Just fork the repository and go.

## Get Started

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (for package management) are installed locally.
3. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally. This project is currently set to use version 4.2.15 but that can be changed.
4. Install packages: `yarn install`.
5. Run tests: `yarn test`/`yarn test:watch`.
6. Run API locally: `yarn start`.
